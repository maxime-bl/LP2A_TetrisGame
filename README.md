## Compiling requirements 

To compile this program you need JDK17. Moreover, you'll have to add the Processing libraries as a module. To do this, add **core.jar** from your Processing repertory in the project dependencies.

## Game class location

Since we are using the Processing API, the Game class had to placed be inside a package, so we could give Processing access to it in the module-info file. **It can be found in the *tetris_game* package**.

## How to run

To execute properly the code, you need to compile and launch **Game.java** from **the parent directory of src and resources**.

## Documentation

You will find in **Documentation.pdf** the more precise explanation of the program.
